# Chess
This is my first attempt at building a real complete game application which involved multiple players (human-human, human-computer) and various game strategies. My intent in developing this game is, to gain programming experience by doing a substantial project, to learn and understand advanced algorithms, and to learn and develop a GUI application with which user (player) can interact. Additionally, AI/deep learning is another topic of great interest to me and I am working on integrating learning capabilities into the game.

Although I am still working on the game, the basic framework required for playing a chess game, such as the GUI, ability to run a game with multiple players (human/computer) is already completed. Initially planning to use the simple strategy (with computer as a player) of using weighted random moves and later add depth search and pruning (algorithms such as MINMAX). I also added PGN (Portable Game Notation) support in the game so that it can read/save games into PGN files. A saved game can be restored or replayed play by play on the GUI. I plan to add AI learning support to the game and will use the PGN reader to train it with some of the well-known games played by Chess Legends.
